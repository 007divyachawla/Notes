# Security Engineering at Google: My Interview Study Notes
## By [nolang](https://twitter.com/__nolang)

I am a security engineer at Google and these are the notes from when I was studying for the interviews. This is my first job in security and a lot of people have asked me how I studied. My notes consist mostly of a list of terms and technologies to learn, plus little tidbits that helped me remember certain details. At the end are interview tips I made for myself and that I find myself saying to others looking to interview.

**If you are less confident at coding:** 
Spend more time writing small scrips and studying features of your preferred language. Coding is essential (even if you don't like it or you don't use it much in your current role). I have a section on coding in this list.

**If you are less confident at security topics:** 
I recommend doing a lot of reading and whenever you come across a term you are unfamiliar with or couldn't easily explain, then add it to the list.
